    <h1>Q&A</h1>
    <article>
        <h2>What is an APRS-IS Passcode and where do I get one?</h2>
        <p>
            Internet Services for APRS (APRS-IS) requires a passcode in order
            to publish data to the service.
            This is only required if you intend to broadcast your location
            to the Internet APRS services, and is intended to control spam and
            limit the sevice to licensed radio operators.
        </p>
        <p>
            We <strong>do not assign these passcodes</strong> and they are
            generated from your license. There are different ways you can
            obtain these, it is up to you to obtain one properly for your
            license.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the advanced user, the command line tool
            <a href="https://github.com/InkApplications/Karps">Karps</a>
            can also generate these for you.

        <h2>Will the application work offline?</h2>
        <p>Yes.</p>
        <p>This application was designed specifically with offline in mind.</p>
        <p>Internet specific features, such as APRS-IS will obviously not be available offline.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h2>Does the application require Play Services?</h2>
        <p>No.</p>
        <p>
            I have gone out of my way to make sure that this application does
            not require Google's Play services and will function on nearly any
            Android device.
